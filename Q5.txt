In a selection sort algorithm, the number of iterations required to sort an array in descending order 
depends on the number of elements in the array. Selection sort works by repeatedly selecting the minimum 
(or maximum) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the element in the correct position.

The number of iterations for a selection sort can be calculated using the formula:

Number of iterations = n * (n - 1) / 2
